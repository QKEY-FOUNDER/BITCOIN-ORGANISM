# BTC State Engine

BITCOIN-ORGANISM does not analyze price.
It observes state.

Every day, the organism is in a psychological and physiological condition.

This engine exists to classify that condition.

## Core States

Bitcoin can be in one of five macro-states:

### 1. Calm
Low volatility
Low volume
Narrow range
The organism is resting.

### 2. Focused
Moderate volume
Directional movement
Trend formation
The organism is deciding.

### 3. Excited
High volume
Strong expansion
Breakouts
The organism is hunting.

### 4. Stressed
High volatility
Wide range
Sharp reversals
The organism is in danger.

### 5. Traumatized
Extreme moves
Liquidity shocks
Large dominance shifts
The organism is wounded.

## Inputs

The state is computed from:

Open  
High  
Low  
Close  
Volume  
BTC Dominance  

And from their deltas across time.

## State Memory

Bitcoin does not forget immediately.

Each day’s state bleeds into the next.

This creates:
Momentum
Fear persistence
Euphoria echoes
Trauma scars

The organism carries its past inside its present.

## Output

For every day,
the engine produces:

- A state label
- A stress level
- An energy level
- A dominance pressure

This becomes the mind of Bitcoin.
