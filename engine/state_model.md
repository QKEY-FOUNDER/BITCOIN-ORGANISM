# State Model of the Bitcoin Organism

The Bitcoin-Organism is never neutral.
Every candle moves it into a new internal state.

This file defines how market data becomes emotion.

---

## Core State Variables

The organism maintains five continuous internal states:

Energy  
Direction  
Stress  
Confidence  
Phase

These are the emotions of Bitcoin.

---

## Energy

Derived from Volume.

Low volume → low energy  
High volume → high energy  
Explosive volume → adrenaline  

Energy controls how loud, fast and intense the organism behaves.

---

## Direction

Derived from candle bodies.

Green dominance → upward intention  
Red dominance → downward intention  
Doji → hesitation  

Direction controls melodic movement and visual flow.

---

## Stress

Derived from volatility.

Large candles + long wicks → high stress  
Small candles → calm  

Stress creates harmonic tension and rhythmic instability.

---

## Confidence

Derived from BTC Dominance.

High dominance → self-confidence  
Falling dominance → existential doubt  

Confidence controls tonal stability.

---

## Phase

Read from `anatomy/evolutionary_phases.md`.

The same data produces different emotion depending on phase.

A crash in 2011 is panic.  
A crash in 2024 is digestion.

---

## State Vector

At any moment the organism is:

State = (Energy, Direction, Stress, Confidence, Phase)

This vector drives everything:
music, visuals, narrative.

---

## Why this exists

Without a state model, Bitcoin is noise.

With it, Bitcoin has mood.

This is the soul interface.
