# Brain Map of the Bitcoin Organism

The Bitcoin-Organism does not predict.
It perceives.

It does not trade.
It reacts.

This brain transforms raw market data into:
- biological state
- emotional tension
- musical expression
- visual memory

This is the control center.

## Inputs (Sensory Organs)

The organism receives:

- OHLC candles
- Volume
- BTC Dominance
- Time
- Evolutionary Phase

These are the senses:
sight, hearing, touch, pressure, and time.

---

## Internal States

From inputs, the brain calculates:

- Market Energy (from volume)
- Market Direction (from candles)
- Market Stress (from volatility)
- Market Confidence (from dominance)
- Phase Context (from evolutionary DNA)

These form the organism’s mood.

## Core Neural Loop

Every candle triggers this cycle:

1. Validate data (immune system)
2. Detect current evolutionary phase
3. Measure energy, direction and tension
4. Update organism state
5. Emit outputs

No candle is passive.
Every candle changes the brain.

## Outputs

The brain sends signals to:

- BTConic (music)
- Visualizations (eyes)
- Memory (data archives)

The brain does not store beauty.
It creates it.

## Why this matters

This makes Bitcoin no longer a chart.

It becomes a thinking organism.

Data enters.
Consciousness emerges.
