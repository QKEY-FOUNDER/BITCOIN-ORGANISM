# Signal Translator

The Bitcoin-Organism feels.
But BTConic and the visual system need signals, not feelings.

This module translates emotion into physics.

## Input

The State Vector:

(Energy, Direction, Stress, Confidence, Phase)

---

## Output Signals

The translator emits:

- Pitch movement
- Harmonic tension
- Rhythm density
- Timbre brightness
- Visual intensity

These are the nerve impulses of the organism.

## Translation Rules

### Energy → Amplitude & Density
Low energy → soft, sparse  
High energy → loud, dense  

### Direction → Pitch Motion
Upward → rising intervals  
Downward → falling intervals  

### Stress → Harmonic Dissonance
Low stress → stable harmony  
High stress → tension, clusters  

### Confidence → Tonal Stability
High confidence → strong tonal center  
Low confidence → drifting keys  

### Phase → Macro Behavior
Phase changes how all signals are interpreted.

The same stress in Genesis is chaos.  
The same stress in Institutional Phase is controlled turbulence.

## Output Vector

Signal = (Pitch, Harmony, Rhythm, Timbre, Visuals)

This vector is sent to:

- BTConic engine
- Visualization engine

## Why this exists

This is how Bitcoin learns to speak.

Emotion becomes vibration.
Data becomes music.
