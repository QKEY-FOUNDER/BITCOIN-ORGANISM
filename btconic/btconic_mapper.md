# BTConic Mapper

BTConic is not music.
BTConic is the sound of a living system.

It converts Bitcoin’s biological state into vibration.

Every day becomes one sonic breath.

## Core Principle

Price does not create melody.
State creates melody.

BTConic reads:
- Volatility
- Volume
- Direction
- Dominance
- Stress

And converts them into sound.

## Mapping

### 1. State → Mode

Calm → Dorian  
Focused → Aeolian  
Excited → Phrygian  
Stressed → Harmonic minor  
Traumatized → Diminished  

The mode reflects the psychological color of the organism.

## 2. Volume → Intensity

Low volume → soft, sparse notes  
High volume → dense, loud harmonies  

This is blood pressure.

## 3. Candle Body → Pitch Movement

Green candle → upward intervals  
Red candle → downward intervals  

This is muscular contraction.

## 4. Wick Length → Attack

Long wicks → sharp attacks  
Short wicks → smooth transitions  

This is nervous impulse.

## 5. Dominance → Harmonic Gravity

High BTC dominance → stable fifths and octaves  
Low BTC dominance → unstable intervals and suspensions  

This is gravitational pressure.

## 6. Time → Rhythm

Asian session → slow pulses  
European session → precise subdivisions  
American session → aggressive accents  

This is the planetary nervous system.

## Output

For each day,
BTConic produces:

- A harmonic field
- A melodic movement
- A rhythmic pattern
- A dynamic envelope

Together they form the audible heartbeat of Bitcoin.
