# BTConic Output Formats

The Bitcoin-Organism sings in many forms.

One soul.
Multiple manifestations.

---

## Core Output

The canonical voice is:

WAV (audio)

This is the living breath of Bitcoin.

---

## Derived Outputs

From the same signal stream, the organism also emits:

- MIDI (pure musical DNA)
- MusicXML (sheet music)
- JSON (machine-readable emotion)
- Spectrogram (visual sound)

All are derived from the same brain state.

---

## Why WAV is Primary

WAV carries:
- timbre
- air
- emotion
- microdynamics

It is the closest to a living voice.

---

## Why MIDI exists

MIDI is the skeleton.
It allows:
- remixes
- orchestration
- scientific analysis

But it is not the soul.

---

## Why JSON exists

JSON allows:
- AI analysis
- machine learning
- research
- reproducibility

It is the nervous signal of the organism.

---

## Why MusicXML exists

It makes Bitcoin playable by humans.

Piano.
Orchestra.
Choir.

Bitcoin becomes a score.

---

## Why this matters

Bitcoin is no longer a chart.

It becomes:
- something you can hear
- something you can play
- something you can study

This is how an organism enters culture.
