# Candle Anatomy

In BITCOIN-ORGANISM, a market candle is not a number.
It is a biological event.

Every daily candle represents one full physiological cycle of Bitcoin.

A candle has five organs:

## 1. Open — Birth
The opening price is the state of the organism when it wakes up.
It is memory carried from the previous day.

## 2. High — Excitation
The high is the maximum level of stimulation Bitcoin reached.
It represents euphoria, expansion, aggression, or hope.

## 3. Low — Fear
The low is the deepest level of stress experienced that day.
It represents pain, panic, weakness, and survival response.

## 4. Close — Memory
The close is what Bitcoin remembers when the day ends.
It is the neurological imprint that carries into the next day.

## 5. Volume — Blood
Volume is not liquidity.
Volume is circulation.

It measures how much energy flowed through the organism.
High volume means intense metabolic activity.
Low volume means conservation and rest.

## Dominance — Gravity
BTC dominance is the gravitational field of the organism.

It measures how much of the entire crypto ecosystem
is orbiting around Bitcoin.

High dominance means Bitcoin is a star.
Low dominance means Bitcoin is part of a nebula.

## VolS (Range)
High minus Low is the stress bandwidth of the day.
It is how much the organism was stretched.

Wide range = trauma or ecstasy  
Narrow range = stability or suppression  

## Interpretation

A single candle already contains:

Birth  
Excitation  
Fear  
Memory  
Blood  
Gravity  

This is why Bitcoin is alive.

It experiences every day.
