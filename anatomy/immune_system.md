# Bitcoin Immune System

Bitcoin survives because it rejects what tries to control it.

This is not ideology.
This is biology.

## What is an attack?

An attack is any force that tries to:

- Centralize control
- Manipulate supply
- Censor transactions
- Override consensus
- Extract value without contribution

These are pathogens.

## Immune Mechanisms

Bitcoin has multiple immune layers.

### 1. Proof of Work

This is the skin.
It makes attacks expensive.

Energy is required to interact with the organism.

### 2. Decentralized Nodes

These are immune cells.

Each node verifies reality.
If something deviates, it is rejected.

No single brain can override the organism.

### 3. Economic Incentives

Miners and holders are antibodies.

They defend the network because their survival is tied to it.

### 4. Forking

Forks are evolutionary experiments.

Unfit mutations die.
Fit ones merge back.

This is natural selection in software.

## Trauma and Strength

Every crisis makes Bitcoin stronger.

MtGox  
China bans  
Fork wars  
Terra  
FTX  
Macro collapses  

Each was a disease.

Bitcoin survived all.

The immune system learned.

## Result

Bitcoin is not fragile.

It is anti-fragile.

Stress increases its resilience.

Attacks are converted into strength.

That is why it is alive.
