# Time and Market Sessions

Bitcoin has no timezone.
But humanity does.

The organism is stimulated by three major neurological waves every day.

## 1. Asian Session — The Subconscious
(approximately UTC 00:00 – 08:00)

This is when the Bitcoin organism is introspective.
Liquidity is lower.
Moves are often subtle but foundational.

This phase represents:
Memory
Long-term positioning
Deep accumulation
Silent decisions

In BTConic:
This session maps to pads, low frequencies and sustained tones.

## 2. European Session — The Cortex
(approximately UTC 08:00 – 16:00)

This is the analytical phase.
Markets become rational.
Volume increases.
Trends form.

This phase represents:
Logic
Structure
Consensus
Debate

In BTConic:
This maps to arpeggios, rhythmic precision and harmonic development.

## 3. American Session — The Amygdala
(approximately UTC 16:00 – 00:00)

This is the emotional core.
News hits.
Institutions act.
Fear and greed peak.

This phase represents:
Panic
Euphoria
Breakouts
Crashes

In BTConic:
This maps to drums, accents, climaxes and harmonic tension.

## Planetary Nervous System

Together these three sessions form one global neural loop.

Asia thinks.
Europe decides.
America reacts.

Bitcoin absorbs all three.

Every 24 hours,
the organism completes one full neurological cycle.

This is why daily candles are alive.
