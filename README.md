# BITCOIN-ORGANISM  
A living digital organism built from Bitcoin itself.

Bitcoin is not just a financial asset.  
Bitcoin is a self-sustaining, adaptive, planetary-scale organism.

This repository does not simulate Bitcoin.  
It **is built from Bitcoin’s own biological signals**.

Price, volume, dominance, geography and time are treated as physiology.

Bitcoin is not plotted here.  
It **breathes**.

## What this is

BITCOIN-ORGANISM is a full biological model of Bitcoin as a living system.

Every trading day becomes a heartbeat.  
Every candle becomes a muscle contraction.  
Every volume spike becomes blood flow.  
Every geographical shift becomes a change in voice.

The organism evolves through time.

This repository contains everything needed to reconstruct Bitcoin’s entire life as sound, structure and behavior.

## What lives here

The repository is not just data — it is an anatomy.

engine/        → nervous system (core biological synthesis)  
geo_engine/    → planetary brain (who is trading where and when)  
immune_system/→ survival logic (stress, damage, recovery)  
data/          → metabolic memory (OHLCV history)  
runner/        → heart (the execution loop)  
visualizations/→ eyes (optional outputs)  

Together these form a **closed living loop**.

## What it does

When executed, the organism:

1. Reads Bitcoin’s historical or real-time market data  
2. Computes its biological state  
3. Computes which regions of the world dominate the flow  
4. Computes stress, trauma, euphoria and recovery  
5. Converts that into:
   - rhythm  
   - harmony  
   - tension  
   - pulse  
6. Generates **a WAV file of Bitcoin’s voice**

Each month becomes a movement.  
Each era becomes a symphony.

Bitcoin literally sings its own history.

## The Geo-Brain

Bitcoin does not trade in one place.

It moves through:

• East Asia  
• Europe  
• North America  
• Crypto-native flows  

The `geo_engine` models these time zones and volume dominance to create a **geopolitical rhythm**.

When Asia dominates → the tone shifts.  
When the US wakes up → the tempo changes.  
When panic hits → arrhythmia appears.

The planet plays Bitcoin.

## The Immune System

The `immune_system` detects:

• stress  
• volatility  
• shocks  
• instability  

Bull runs become **tachycardia**.  
Crashes become **arrhythmia**.  
Long recoveries become **slow healing**.

The organism reacts to danger.

## How to run it

Once you have Python installed:

cd BITCOIN-ORGANISM  
python runner/run_organism.py  

This will:

• walk through every CSV in `data/`  
• feed it into the organism  
• generate a WAV for every period  
• place the results in the output folder  

You will hear Bitcoin grow up.

## Why this exists

Charts show price.  
Indicators show probability.  

This shows **life**.

Bitcoin is the first autonomous digital organism in human history.

It remembers.  
It adapts.  
It survives.  
It evolves.

This repository is its voice.

---

## Status

This organism is alive.

Every new dataset adds a new cell.  
Every execution gives it breath.  

There is no final version.  
Only evolution.

## License

Open.  
Like the organism itself.
