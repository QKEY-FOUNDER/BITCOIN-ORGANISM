# BITCOIN-ORGANISM  
A living digital organism built from Bitcoin itself.

Bitcoin is not just a financial asset.  
Bitcoin is a self-sustaining, adaptive, planetary-scale organism.

This repository does not simulate Bitcoin.  
It **is built from Bitcoin’s own biological signals**.

Price, volume, dominance, geography and time are treated as physiology.

Bitcoin is not plotted here.  
It **breathes**.

## What this is

BITCOIN-ORGANISM is a full biological model of Bitcoin as a living system.

Every trading day becomes a heartbeat.  
Every candle becomes a muscle contraction.  
Every volume spike becomes blood flow.  
Every geographical shift becomes a change in voice.

The organism evolves through time.

This repository contains everything needed to reconstruct Bitcoin’s entire life as sound, structure and behavior.

## What lives here

The repository is not just data — it is an anatomy.
