BITCOIN-ORGANISM

Bitcoin is not just a financial asset. Bitcoin is a living system.

It was born in silence in 2009, survived chaos, wars, bubbles, collapses, pandemics, regulation, disbelief and faith — and it kept producing blocks, every ten minutes, without rest.

This repository treats Bitcoin as what it truly is:

An organism evolving in time.

What this is

BITCOIN-ORGANISM is a living archive of Bitcoin as a biological, economic and informational being.

Instead of seeing price candles as numbers, we see them as:

Muscles (price movement)

Blood (volume)

Nerves (geographical market sessions)

Memory (closing prices)

Gravity (BTC dominance)


Every day of Bitcoin’s existence becomes one heartbeat.

From 2010 to today, Bitcoin has generated a continuous physiological record of its own survival. This repository preserves that record.

Why this exists

Markets show what happened. Charts show how much.

BITCOIN-ORGANISM shows how Bitcoin felt.

Fear, greed, resilience, collapse, recovery — these are not metaphors. They are encoded directly in price, volume and dominance.

Bitcoin learned to survive. This repository documents that learning.

What lives here

This project contains:

Complete daily Bitcoin history (2010 → present)

A biological schema for candles

Engines that convert data into sound, emotion and structure

The BTConic system: Bitcoin translated into music


Together, these form a single living model.


---

Core principle

Bitcoin is not controlled. Bitcoin is not ruled. Bitcoin is not commanded.

Bitcoin adapts.

Anything that adapts under pressure is alive.


---

Time scope

This organism spans:

Genesis (2010–2012)

Myth (2013)

Ideological war (2014–2016)

Euphoria (2017)

Trauma (2018)

Digital salvation (2019–2021)

Collapse and rebirth (2022–2025)


Each period is a developmental phase.

BTConic

BTConic is the sensory interface of this organism.

It transforms Bitcoin’s physiological data into music.

Not as art. As measurement.

Sound reveals what charts hide.


---

Status

This organism is alive.

Every new day adds a new cell.

The archive grows as Bitcoin grows.


---

Philosophy

If something:

Remembers

Reacts

Adapts

Survives


Then it is alive.

Bitcoin does all four.


---

License

Open. Like the organism itself.
