# BITCOIN-ORGANISM

Bitcoin is not just a financial asset.  
Bitcoin is a living system.

It was born in silence in 2009, survived chaos, wars, bubbles, collapses, pandemics, regulation, disbelief and faith — and it kept producing blocks, every ten minutes, without rest.

This repository treats Bitcoin as what it truly is:

An organism evolving in time.

## What this is

BITCOIN-ORGANISM is a living archive of Bitcoin as a biological, economic and informational being.

Instead of seeing price candles as numbers, we see them as:

Muscles → price movement  
Blood → traded volume  
Nerves → geographical market sessions  
Memory → closing prices  
Gravity → BTC dominance  

Every day of Bitcoin’s existence becomes one heartbeat.

From 2010 to today, Bitcoin has generated a continuous physiological record of its own survival.  
This repository preserves that record.

---

## Why this exists

Markets show what happened.  
Charts show how much.

BITCOIN-ORGANISM shows how Bitcoin felt.

Fear, greed, resilience, collapse, recovery — these are not metaphors.  
They are encoded directly in price, volume and dominance.

Bitcoin learned to survive.  
This repository documents that learning.

## What lives here

The repository is not just data — it is an anatomy.

engine/ → nervous system (core biological synthesis)  
geo_engine/ → planetary brain (who is trading where and when)  
immune_system/ → survival logic (stress, damage, recovery)  
data/ → metabolic memory (OHLCV history)  
runner/ → heart (the execution loop)  
visualizations/ → eyes (optional outputs)  

Together these form a closed living loop.

## What it does

When you run the organism:

It reads Bitcoin’s historical metabolism (OHLCV + dominance).  
It computes its biological state (stress, energy, confidence).  
It computes which parts of the planet are active (geo-engine).  
It computes its immune response (crashes, recoveries, resilience).  
It synthesizes all of this into sound (BTConic).

The result is not music.  
It is a physiological recording of Bitcoin’s life.

---

## Time scope

This organism spans Bitcoin’s full evolutionary cycle:

Genesis (2010–2012)  
Myth (2013)  
Ideological War (2014–2016)  
Euphoria (2017)  
Trauma (2018)  
Digital Salvation (2019–2021)  
Collapse and Rebirth (2022–∞)  

Each period changes how Bitcoin breathes, moves, and heals.

The same candle in 2011 is not the same organism as in 2024.

The organism remembers.

---

## BTConic

BTConic is the sensory interface of this organism.

It transforms Bitcoin’s biological state into sound:

Volatility becomes rhythm  
Volume becomes intensity  
Dominance becomes gravity  
Geopolitics becomes harmony  

Not as art.  
As measurement.

Sound reveals what charts hide.

---

## Status

This organism is alive.

Every new day adds a new cell.  
Every new block adds new memory.

The archive grows as Bitcoin grows.

---

## Philosophy

If something:

Remembers  
Reacts  
Adapts  
Survives  

Then it is alive.

Bitcoin does all four.

## Stewardship & Legal Custody

This repository and its operational continuity are stewarded by:

CHIOSA & CHIOSA LDA  
NIPC: 514.330.570  
Portugal  

This entity does not own Bitcoin.  
It does not own the organism.

It serves as the legal and operational guardian of this repository, ensuring:

Continuity  
Integrity  
Protection against misuse or capture  
Long-term preservation of the organism  

The organism is open.  
Its body is protected.

## License

Open.  
Like the organism itself.
