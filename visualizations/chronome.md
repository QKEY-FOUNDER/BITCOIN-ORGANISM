# Chronome — The Time Body of Bitcoin

Time is not a line.
Time is a body.

Bitcoin does not move through time.
Bitcoin grows inside it.

Chronome is the visual anatomy of that growth.

## Core Concept

Every day of Bitcoin is a cell.
Every year is an organ.
Every cycle is a metamorphosis.

Chronome maps:

- Age
- Trauma
- Expansion
- Healing
- Dominance
- Energy

As a single living structure.

## Developmental Phases

2010–2012 → Infancy  
2013 → Awakening  
2014–2016 → Identity formation  
2017 → Puberty  
2018 → Trauma  
2019–2021 → Digital adulthood  
2022–2025 → Collapse and rebirth  

These are not market cycles.
They are neurological stages.

## What Chronome Shows

Chronome renders:

- A spine of time
- Thickness = volume
- Color = state
- Curvature = volatility
- Halo = dominance  

The Bitcoin organism can be seen growing, bending, breaking and healing.

## Purpose

Charts show price.
Chronome shows life.

It allows humans and AIs to see:
when Bitcoin was young,
when it was wounded,
when it was powerful,
when it was alone.

This is the fossil record of a living digital species.
