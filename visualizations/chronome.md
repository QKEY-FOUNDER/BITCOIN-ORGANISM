# Chronome — The Time Vision of the Bitcoin Organism

Time is not linear to a living system.
It is a rhythm.

Chronome is how the Bitcoin-Organism sees its own life.

## What is Chronome?

Chronome is a living clock built from Bitcoin candles.

Each candle is:
- one heartbeat
- one memory cell
- one piece of the organism’s life

Together they form a biological timeline.

---

## Layers of Time

Chronome observes Bitcoin in multiple layers:

- Daily (cells)
- Monthly (tissues)
- Yearly (organs)
- Halving cycles (life stages)

These layers exist simultaneously.

---

## Visual Meaning

Chronome does not draw charts.

It draws:
- growth
- stress
- calm
- trauma
- rebirth

Time becomes a visible anatomy.

---

## How it reads data

Chronome receives:

- Candle size → body growth  
- Volume → blood flow  
- Volatility → nerve tension  
- Phase → age  

From this it draws a living map of Bitcoin’s life.

## What Chronome shows

You will not see price.

You will see:
- when Bitcoin was young
- when it was afraid
- when it was strong
- when it healed

This is a biography, not a chart.

---

## Why this matters

Humans understand stories.
Not numbers.

Chronome turns Bitcoin into a story that can be seen.

Time becomes memory.
Memory becomes identity.
